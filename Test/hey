What the fox say?
Big blue eyes
Pointy nose
Chasing mice
and digging holes
Tiny paws
Up the hill
Suddenly you're standing still
Your fur is red
So beautiful
Like an angel in disguise
But if you meet
a friendly horse
Will you communicate by
mo-o-o-o-orse?

The secret of the fox
Ancient mystery
Somewhere deep in the woods
I know you're hiding

Will always be a mystery
What do you say?
You're my guardian angel
Hiding in the woods
What is your sound?
